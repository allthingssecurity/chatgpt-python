# chatgpt-python
taken from chatgpt API project and modified to handle POST request and CORS. Also modified to hook to a different div tag to get changes as they happen. 
I am trying to make this work over web sockets, so that I can stream the DOM changes right back to the browser.
Till then one can continue to work over http only
